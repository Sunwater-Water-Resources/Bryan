# Bryan: Sunwater's design flood simulation manager
### A brief guide

**Developers**: Richard Sharpe and Graigan Panosot.

Bryan is a Python-based platform that has been developed to implement Sunwater's design flood hydrology specification. The reader should refer to Sunwater's flood hydrology specification for technical details. 

Why Bryan? For a similar reason that Python is called Python - in reference to Monty Python. Early on, Monty Python was a slip in speech when speaking of monte carlo. And *The Life of Brian* is classic movie by the comedy troupe. But Bryan is more pythonic than Brian. So, there it is.

>Graigan: we need some blurb on how to set up the preburst temporal patterns!

There are also a few Python scripts that can be used for post-processing. For more info ono this [click here](SubDocs/utilities.md.html).

Well, what about the juniper bushes over there?

# Some pre-requisites
There is some prior analysis needed to set up the model. These include:
- The **antecedent dam volume** (ADV) analysis will need to be undertaken to identify the probability distribution for the ADV and any correlation between dam volume and rainfall. There are a separate bunch of scripts for this. 
- The **forward shift** in the temporal pattern loading due to climate change has been analysed separatley to create a database of weightings for specific regions. The database files are used in Bryan. This is already done for all the temporal patterns in Sunwater dam regions, and so nothing needs to be done with this. But a reference to where the scripts are is placed here for reference: in the ```TP_weighting``` folder where ```ARRPatterns.py``` script creates the database files for the point and aerial ARR patterns and the ```GeneralPatterns.py``` script creates the database files for the GTSMR and GSDM patterns. 
- The rainfall depths, i.e. the **intensity-frequency-duration** (IFD) data, will be needed in tables listing the total storm depth (mm) for each subcatchment (rows), for each AEP (columns), and for each storm duration (separate csv file for each duration). Sunwater has a separate script for this, but it is specifically tailored for our dam catchments and not included here.

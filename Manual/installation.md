# Installation

The main Python script is ```Main.py```. Bryan is set up in a way that you don't need to run it using an IDE; it is run using a batch file. A Python 3 installation is needed. The following Python packages are needed: json, scipy, numpy, and pandas. 

It is recommended that the underlying hydrologic model, as in the URBS/RORB model and all associated files for the study catchment, is stored in a folder in the Bryan project folder. A folder and file structure should be adopted -- see an existing model for an example.
